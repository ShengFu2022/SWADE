# SWADE
A landslide dating technique based on Segmented WAvelet-DEnoising and stepwise linear fitting (SWADE)


One main file contains the SWADE code in the file of 'SWADE.py'. Three function files are 'b_read_Act_Axel_Lr.py', 'c_deno_wave.py' and'd_step_wise.py'. When run the main file, all the four files should be in the same file folder.

For people who knows how to download by using gee and geemap, one code to download our training data of NDVI timeseries is suggested in the file of 'DownloadNDVIFromGEETranslatedFromAxelCode.ipynb'.
