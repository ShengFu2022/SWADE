# SWADE
Segmented WAvelet-DEnoising and stepwise linear fitting (SWADE) is one landslide dating technique that employs the principle that vegetation is often removed by landsliding in vegetated areas, causing a temporal decrease in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The methods and results are illustrated in our publications in (Link).

## How to use this filefolder
The listed code file hmakes it easier to check website online. When users run our code, the filefolder of 'CodeShengFu2022Landslides' is more suggested. <br/>
1 download and extract the code file. Open the 'CodeShengFu2022Landslides' filefolder.<br/>
2 install Anaconda. Run the Python modual.<br/>
3 In the python interface, go to the file folder of 'CodeShengFu2022Landslides'. <br/>
4 Run it. One figure output will be saved in the file of 'output'.<br/>
5 Figure example: <br/>

Extra file: For people who knows how to download by using gee and geemap, one code to download our training data of NDVI timeseries is suggested in the file of 'DownloadNDVIFromGEETranslatedFromAxelCode.ipynb'. You can download one excel file and compare it to our uploaded file. Feel free to propose any question upon this and contact us freely.
